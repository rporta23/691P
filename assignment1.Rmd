For domestic arrivals, 71% arrived on-time with an average delay time of 64 minutes for delayed flights. 3.5% of domestic flights were canceled in 2022.[@RITABTSTranstats]

TPA is known for its high rankings in customer satisfaction. In 2022, JD Powerâ€™s Airport Satisfaction Study ranked TPA number one in the U.S. based on its high quality terminal facilities, airport arrival/departure processes; baggage claim; security check; check-in/baggage check; and food, beverage and retail.[@PowerNamesTPA] In July 2023, a study by FloridaRentals.com ranked TPA third best in Florida based on its low percentage of delays and cancellations along with other factors.[@reportsStudyListsTampa2023] Most recently, USA TODAY has named TPA a finalist in their annual 10Best Readers Choice Awards program for 2023. The final winner will be determined by public voting.[@TPABestLarge]

Beyond excellent customer experience, a unique element of TPA is its extensive public art collection.[@PublicArtCollection] Recently, a twenty-one foot tall flamingo statue created by artist Matthew Mazzotta, which lives in the airport, received a prestigious international art award.[@TampaInternationalAirport]

Furthermore, TPA is making active efforts toward environmental sustainability. 42% of planes run on alternative fuels including CNG, electric and hybrid. The airport hosts 15 electric vehicle charging stations for public use and gives preferential parking to people with alternative fuel vehicles. They also use reclaimed water for landscape irrigation and cooling towers. Moreover, TPA has reduced electricity consumption by 10% per passenger since 2011. The airport administration has a comprehensive plan for extending sustainability efforts even further over the next several years.[@OurSustainabilityProgram]
